# BitBattle
Simple Unity 2D platformer game

  Bitbattle is a 2D platformer game made in Unity. It uses a 8-bit style reminiscent of early video games. Navigate using WASD keys, and right click to spawn a slash. The goal of the game is to small all of the replicatiors, which spawn enemies. After all of the replicators are destroyed, a Data Bus will appear to ferry the player to the next level.
